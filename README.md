    * [cite_start]Built and configured the MDT/WDS server from the ground up[cite: 25].
    * Developed automated deployment sequences for Windows 10, ensuring standardized configurations.
    * [cite_start]Streamlined driver and application installation processes, reducing post-deployment manual intervention[cite: 25].
    * Ensured compatibility and efficiency across diverse hardware.
* **Technologies Used:** Windows Server, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT), Windows Deployment Services (WDS), PowerShell, Group Policy.
* **Impact:** Significantly reduced the time required for new endpoint deployments, improved consistency across the environment, and provided a scalable solution for future OS upgrades.
