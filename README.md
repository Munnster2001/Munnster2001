## üöÄ Featured Projects & Case Studies

My portfolio of projects highlights my hands-on experience, problem-solving abilities, and impact on organizational efficiency and stability.

### **1. Windows 10 Enterprise Rollout & Automated Deployment System**
* **Year:** 2019
* **Challenge:** Manual OS deployments were time-consuming and inconsistent, leading to inefficient user onboarding and support challenges.
* **Solution:** Designed and implemented a robust automated deployment solution using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and Windows Deployment Services (WDS). This involved building the server infrastructure and automating driver and application injection directly into the images.
* **My Role:** Led the design, implementation, and automation of the Windows 10 deployment process.
* **Key Contributions:**
    * Built and configured the MDT/WDS server from the ground up.
    * Developed automated task sequences for OS installation, driver injection, and application deployment.
    * Managed image updates and driver packages for diverse hardware.
* **Technologies Used:** Windows Server, MDT, WDS, PowerShell, Group Policy.
* **Impact:** Significantly reduced the time required for new endpoint deployments (e.g., contributing to a 30-45 minute reduction per user for onboarding/offboarding), improved consistency across the environment, and provided a scalable solution.

### **2. Enterprise Exchange Mailbox Migration (Exchange 2010 to 2016)**
* **Year:** 2023
* **Challenge:** The existing Exchange 2010 environment was approaching end-of-life, posing security risks and lacking modern functionalities.
* **Solution:** Led the complex migration of all mailboxes and public folders from Exchange 2010 to Exchange 2016. This involved careful planning, phased migration strategies, and extensive post-migration validation.
* **My Role:** Managed the end-to-end planning, execution, and post-migration support for the Exchange environment upgrade.
* **Key Contributions:**
    * Conducted a comprehensive assessment and designed the new Exchange 2016 architecture.
    * Performed phased mailbox and public folder migrations using native Exchange tools, minimizing user impact.
    * Configured coexistence between Exchange 2010 and 2016 during the transition.
* **Technologies Used:** Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Microsoft Exchange Server 2016, Active Directory, PowerShell.
* **Impact:** Modernized the organization's email infrastructure, enhanced security posture, improved reliability, and enabled access to newer Exchange features.

### **3. JAMF Pro Deployment for Mac Management**
